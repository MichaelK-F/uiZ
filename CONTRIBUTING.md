# Contributing

Hi there! Thank you for being interested in uiZ. As you may know, this asset is distributed in multiple ways:

* Once under the GPL for free, open source or personal use.
* Once under a proprietay example for open source.

This means there have to be some rules and GPL exceptions for contributing. Therefore, I (TtheCreator) as manager and creator of this project retain the possiblity to sell seperate copies of this program for personal use. You do not.

If you have contributed a considerable amount, and would like to use this in your game then I may grant you a commercial use license if you ask nicely enough. (Though this is not a right of yours)

If you do not agree to the license, you cannot merge to this repository.
