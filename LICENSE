This license is an agreement between you (either an individual or organization of some sort), the software product this license covers and the software owner.

## 1. terminology
You are being referred to by as "you”, “individual” or “license holder”.
The person who has made this software is referred to as the “owner” or “software owner”. This person is Thomas Saedt. Contact can be made trough the email address: epostvanthomas@kpnmail.nl. Contact information may be subject to change.
The software product this license covers is a shared-source codebase provided to you. This means that upon the purchase or the acquirement of a license for the product you receive uncompiled, non-binary (somewhat human readable) computer code. This computer code is not available to the public and not to be made public by the license holder. Some parts of the provided code base may still be supplied in a binary format, including (but not limited to) dynamic linking library files, binary tools, and binary assets such as image or sound. The term “software” in this agreement refers to the binary or non-binary software and surrounding assets provided to you by the owner. Software that follows the restrictions given in part C may be referred to as “distributed software”, “distributable software”, “binary software” or “compiled software”.

## 2. Validity of the license
This document is both the license and license agreement for the uiZ software product. This license is only valid in combination with the supplied software product and with proof of purchase trough any of the following platforms:
-	The YoYoGames marketplace from the published “TtheCreator” (https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/4821/uiz-ultimate-gui-framework)
-	Through direct contact with the owner of the software
This license may not be sublicensed to another organization or individual. This means that no contract or agreement may be made by the license holder that allows another party to use the software outside the restrictions of part C.
If this license agreement is broken by the license holder, the right to use the software ceases to exist. The software owner may also choose to stop the validity of a license for a person or organization, without reason. If a valid license becomes invalid, the software may not be acquired again unless permitted by the software owner.
This license agreement may be changed at any time by the software owner. Any existing software agreements will then become invalid and license holders may continue use of the software after agreeing to the newly supplied terms.

## 3. use in organization vs individual use
(part A) If this software and its license are sold to a single individual, it may not be used in a (commercial or non-commercial) “group” or “organization” unless one of the following statements is true:
-	You are a chief or leader of the organization. 
-	You are a part of the organization but not a chief or a leader and you haven’t already used this software inside another organization.
-	You have been given permission by the software owner to do so.
(end part A)
The software license may be transferred from an individual to an organization once. The individual may then not use the software anymore for personal purposes, unless that individual is owner or leader of the organization. The software license may not be transferred from organization to organization.
(part B) To any person in the organization who utilizes this software and hasn’t introduced the software to the organization as described in part A applies the following:
-	You are not allowed to redistribute the software to anyone outside the organization, or anyone in the organization who does not agree to these terms (the terms described in part B, this part). 
-	You are not allowed to use the software product for individual use. 
Part C of this document can counter the terms described in this part (part B)
(end part B)

## 4. Redistribution of the software
(part C)
This software may be redistributed if any of the following conditions are true:
-	The software is redistributed in a compiled, binary form in which the originally provided source code or assets are not accessible. (This counts for both commercial and non-commercial applications)
-	The person who you are sharing the software with (in any form; modified or not modified) also holds a license to use this software.
 (end part C)
Any uncompiled/non-binary version of the software must include this license agreement.
You are not required to supply a license to any end user of the compiled software. You are not required to give any credit to the software owner; however, you may choose to follow guidelines in an optionally included “CONTRIBUTING” file included with the software.

## 5. Warranty
This software comes with no guaranteed warranty. Any support or warranty provided is provided in good faith. The software owner may refuse support for any reason. This includes but is not limited to: Lack of skill or competence in understanding matter or explaining oneself or broken or rude language.
